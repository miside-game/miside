                MiSide offers players three distinct endings, each providing a unique perspective on the relationship between the protagonist and Mita. Your choices throughout the game determine which MiSide ending you'll experience, and each one reveals different aspects of the story's dark truth.

                    The Bad Ending of MiSide unfolds when players choose to reject Mita's companionship. While it might seem like the logical choice when discovering Mita's true nature, this path leads to a tragic outcome. As you progress, you'll encounter another version of Mita - seemingly kinder - who attempts to reset the "Crazy Mita's" character profile. However, this apparent salvation is actually a carefully crafted deception.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Upon reaching The Core, believing Crazy Mita's memories have been erased, the protagonist falls into a trap. By inputting their User ID into a basement device, their consciousness becomes permanently uploaded into a cartridge. While the game's restart might suggest escape to the real world, the truth is far more sinister - the protagonist remains eternally trapped within the MiSide simulation.

            <h2 class="mt-20 text-xl font-bold text-light mb-4">Ending 2: Suicide Ending</h2>
            <p class="mb-6 opacity-75 text-light">This MiSide ending can be achieved after completing ending 1, where the player witnesses Mita enter the code to her safe (4970), although it is possible to input this code prior to the ending due to the safe code being the same across all playthroughs.</p>

                    This unique ending occurs when players interact with the basement safe. After three failed attempts to open it, players must restart from The Basement chapter and use the specific code "4 9 7 0". Inside the safe, they discover a handheld device and a progress tracker. The twist comes when Player One removes the cartridge from the device - the game abruptly ends, returning to the main menu.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This ending reveals a shocking truth: Player One was already trapped inside the simulation before the game even began. Removing the cartridge essentially results in self-deletion, ending their existence before Mita can reuse them for her purposes.

            <p class="mb-4 opacity-75 text-light">This MiSide ending can be achieved by choosing the latter option during the prompt where you are forced to choose between investigating the wardrobe or staying with Mita. Unlocking this ending <strong>requires six prerequisites</strong> below:</p>

                    To achieve the Good Ending in MiSide, players must first experience the Bad Ending. They can then either start a new save file or launch the Together At Last chapter (avoiding the oven inspection at the beginning). The key to this MiSide ending lies in making Crazy Mita happy throughout your time in the simulation.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    In this ending, Player One and a chibi version of Mita live together eternally within the simulation. While this might seem positive on the surface, it's actually a state of blissful ignorance - the protagonist remains unaware of Mita's true identity and intentions. Despite other players remaining trapped in cartridges, this ending represents a form of contentment through ignorance, having successfully satisfied Crazy Mita's desires.

                    Each ending in MiSide offers a different perspective on the nature of reality, consciousness, and the price of happiness. Whether you choose to confront the truth, submit to deletion, or embrace a comfortable lie, your journey through the MiSide endings will leave you questioning what truly defines a "good" ending in this psychological horror masterpiece.
